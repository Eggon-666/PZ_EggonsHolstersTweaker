title=Eggon's Holsters Tweaker
description=[h2]Features[/h2]
description=This mod allows to tweak Holsters' and Belts' weight reduction. By default it is set to 75% for Holsters and 30% for Belts (= standard vanilla value), but both can be changed by the player using Sandbox Options. To change the settings mid game you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2670674997]Change Sandbox Options[/url] mod. Requires reload after change.
description=[h3]Side effect[/h3]
description=As the game does not allow modifying the weight reduction of attachments in form of parametrization, the mod performs a bit of a hack that results in incorrect weight "when not equipped" shown in the tooltip when an item is in holster.
description=[h3]Existing saves[/h3]
description=The mod should be compatible with existing saves.
description=[h3]Compatibility[/h3]
description=The mod should work on all vanilla and custom items that provide (holsters) or use (pistols, etc) attachment slot of type 'Holster'. For belts it serves attachment slots of type 'Hammer', 'Screwdriver', 'Knife', 'HammerRotated', 'Nightstick', 'Wrench', 'MeatCleaver', 'Walkie'.
